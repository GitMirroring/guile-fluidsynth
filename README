Guile-Fluidsynth
Guile bindings to the fluidsynth library

** Description

Guile-Fluidsynth is a Guile Scheme bindings library to the fluidsynth
library.

Assuming you have successfully installed guile-fluidfsynth, here is how
to make a synthesizer and play a note. Fire your preferred guile
session, then:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme{
  scheme@(guile-user)> ,use (f-synth)
  scheme@(guile-user)> (make <synth>)
  ⇒ $5 = #<<synth> 7f746c768db0>

  scheme@(guile-user)> (noteon $5 0 60 100)
#+END_SRC

If everything went well, it should have played a "Yamaha Grand Piano" C4
(middle c) 261.63 Hz note.

The (make <synth>) command may display of one or two warnings , which
may safely be ignored. Please consult the documentation ("Using
Guile-Fluidsynth", "Make a Synthesizer - Play a Note") for a complete
description.
